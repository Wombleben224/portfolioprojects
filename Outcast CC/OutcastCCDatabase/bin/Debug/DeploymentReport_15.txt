     Possible data issues
       The column [dbo].[AspNetUsers].[MemberId] on table [dbo].[AspNetUsers] must be added, but the column has no default
         value and does not allow NULL values. If the table contains data, the ALTER script will not work. To avoid this issue
         you must either: add a default value to the column, mark it as allowing NULL values, or enable the generation of
         smart-defaults as a deployment option.

** User actions
